# [!DNL Quality Patches Tool]: A self-service tool for quality patches

[!DNL Quality Patches Tool(QPT)] is a self-service command line tool that allows you to apply, revert, and view general information about quality patches for Adobe Commerce (both on-premises and on cloud infrastructure).

These patches fix known issues and bugs to improve the stability, security, and performance of your Adobe Commerce implementation. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>You should use the tool to pull in necessary quality fixes as needed on a case-by-case basis only and not as a long-term approach to maintaining Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source code. Upgrading to the latest version of Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source is still the best method for resolving quality issues and should be prioritized.
